## Educational Math Platformer built with **Godot**

This is an educational platformer game built during the pandemic to give my daughter more math practice in a hopefully a fun way.

It's early in the construction of the game.  Levels are limited,  there aren't many different enemies, and there will be bugs.  However I decided I wanted to put this out there for other parents and educators.

The assets were purchased from [Kenney](https://kenney.itch.io)

Please enjoy and check back often for updates as things are moving and being added most days.
